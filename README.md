# pot_odds_calculator
Creating this for fun. Its purpose is to allow you to enter information about a poker hand and it will tell you what pot odds you need for certain situations.
I am coding it in C++ using Qt creator so that I can make use of the built in UI operations.
There will be an SRS document, as well as architecture and class diagrams.
I am mainly doing this to get more familiar with the entire software development process.
